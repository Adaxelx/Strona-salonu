# Strona-salonu

My first page for client. It's hair salon website made for friend of mine. It's in use since 2019. 

# Motivation

Project exists because I thought about that it's good to have own website as buisness grow up. So after talk I decided that I will create a new website for that purpose. 

# About code

Mainly I'm proud of animation when page is changing. In my first projects in react i didn't like that pages fast jump between them. I saw on many pages that they using sort of animations so I decided to put something like that on my own page.
